Like: Did you know that there is enough D N A in the average person's body to stretch from the sun to Pluto and back 17 times. And that the average human body carries ten times more bacterial cells than human cells. I bet you didn't! I am also experimenting with new things, for example: Sarcasm. I hope you find me useful while you use the: N H C U or, N S I N N Housing Computation Unit."
